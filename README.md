### Hi there 👋

Hi, my name is Ollie Gane from the UK 🇬🇧. I'm currently studying for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of London remotely while living on an island in the south of Thailand 🏝️🇹🇭.

I currently have basic knowledge of Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Outside of my university studies, I'm interested in learning React and databases, which I am exploring through The Odin Project.

Ask me about living remotely in Thailand 💬
